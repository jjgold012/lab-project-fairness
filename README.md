For more details look at [Project.pdf](https://github.cs.huji.ac.il/jjgold/lab-project-fairness/blob/master/Project.pdf) and [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.00044.pdf)

## Requirements
Run:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## old_project
In order to run the old project run:
```
python old_project/fairness.py
```

## fairness_project
In order to run this project with on one of the data sets in the folder ```fairness_project/datasets/``` choose an option
file from ```fairness_project/options/``` and Run
```
python fairness_project/start.py fairness_project/options/<any options json file>
```

Or you can create your own option file:
```

**Notice that the options ```json``` file can't contain any comments! because it will not parsed correctly if it does.

In order to rub the project with synthetic data run:
```
python fairness_project/start.py <epsilon>
```

The synthetic data is generated like this
1. Choose target value ```y``` randomly from ```{0,1}```.
2. Choose ```x_0 = y``` with probability ```1 - <epsilon>``` else ```x_0 = 1 - y```
3. Choose ```x_1 = y``` with probability ```1 - 2*<epsilon>``` else ```x_0 = 1 - y```
4. Run the problem with protected value ```x_0```

### Results
The outputs results can be seen in the ```results``` folder.

** The ```default, adult, ucla-law-school``` data sets result are with train set size of 20% because the data set is quite large and it ran for a long time.
